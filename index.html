        <h3>Muay Thai</h3>
        <p>I'm a Muay Thai practitioner, an ancient martial art from Thailand. I remember watching movies of Van Damme and Jackie Chan and thinking: "That looks cool! Wish I can do that!". Turns out I can (well somethings). The greatest lesson was that I could actually learned those kind of things, talent not required. Ever heard of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUGO1cRie7o">Tony Jaa</a>, the Thai Jackie Chan?</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I enjoy cooking tasty, yummy food. I always try to learn new recipes from the people around me. I like the look of neatly chopped onions and the sizzling sound of ingredients going into the pan. My favourite part? The eating! üòÅ</p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>Computers and technology have always fashinated me. Since I was young, besides liking playing video games, I had fun tinkering and learning about computers. I love Linux and it's philosophy of having total control over your computer. It sure encourages you to learn a bit more of how your system works. I also built this website.</p>
