    <h1>YOLO</h1>
    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      YOLO is a webapp that allows you to search for bucket list items inspiration.
      It was developed in Ruby on Rails on the final two weeks of Le Wagon's 10-week bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team was composed by 3 elements, and the tasks were evenly distributed between everyone, so we all got to
      develop both the front and the back end.
    </p>
    <p>
      First step was a one day design sprint, where we built a UI kit and created a core user journey using <span
        class="keyword">Figma</span>. Our core user journey was:
      <ol>
       <li>User lands on homepage, can see multiple experiences and can do a search;</li>
       <li>The user sees it's search results;</li>
       <li>The user chooses one experience and can see it's details;</li>
       <li>The user can add that experience to the bucket list, and chooses a data and a penalty in case the task doesn't
         get completed;</li>
       <li>The user can go to the dashboard and see a summary of tasks to be done.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      After teachers validation, at the end of the day we presented our core user journey to the class.

    <!-- project setup: git repo, models, first deployment -->
    <!-- objectives until end of week, then revised each day. Kanban board, agile methodology -->
    <!-- programming started: start of day define tasks, each chose user story and implemented route, controller, view -->
